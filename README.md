## A10fy — a Gemini extension for Chromium based browsers

A10fy brings Google Gemini-powered AI browser assistant and chat with interactive features to your browser’s side panel. No data is sent to any servers besides Google’s own Gemini API endpoint, thus you will need a valid Google Gemini services (free or paid) API key.
